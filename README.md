# CCIP Masterclass

This project contains all the exercises and examples from the Chainlink CCIP Masterclass, designed to provide hands-on experience with Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). The exercises cover various scenarios of transferring tokens and data between blockchains, as well as implementing a cross-chain Tic Tac Toe game using CCIP.

## Exercises
1. **Exercise #1: Transfer Tokens** - Learn how to transfer tokens across different blockchains using CCIP.
2. **Exercise #2: Transfer Tokens & Data** - Expand on the first exercise by including data in the cross-chain transfer.
3. **Exercise #3: CCIP Tic Tac Toe** - Implement a cross-chain Tic Tac Toe game using CCIP to synchronize game states between blockchains.
